# Short Courses Overview

The set of courses listed here are suggested subsets that you can work through as a self-paced course or that instructors can deliver, based on the time available. The course times provided are estimates and allow for questions and discussions with an instructor that may arise. We suggest that you allow an extra hour on top of the course time for initial software download and setup, and download of the sample data.

  - [**Mini Course (< 60 mins)**](Mini-Course-60-mins.md) — Brief introduction to the CoastWatch Utilities, demonstration of both CDAT and two command line tools (suggested for a meeting demo). Add more command line tools or CDAT functionality if time allows.
  - [**Short Course (< 1 day)**](Short-Course-1-day.md) — Full introduction to the CoastWatch Utilities and full run through of basic CDAT + some advanced CDAT features, three command line tools (no data processing).
  - [**Medium Course (1-2 days)**](Medium-Course-1-2-days.md) — Full introduction, full basic + most advanced CDAT features, extensive command line tools for both data extraction and processing, limited assignments.

We expect a full instructor-led course to require 3 or more days to complete all units and exercises with time for assignments, breaks and discussions.

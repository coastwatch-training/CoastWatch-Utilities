# Unit 2 Overview

In this unit, we'll learn the basics of the CoastWatch Data Analysis Tool (CDAT):

  - How to start CDAT and open a data file
  - Changing the color palette and minimum/maximum scale values
  - Turning on overlays like coast lines, grid lines, and quality masks
  - Using the tool bar to explore and zoom in on the data
  - Exporting the data view to an image

### Resources

For the exercises in this unit, you'll need to download the [cw_utils_sample_data.zip](../downloads/cw_utils_sample_data.zip) file that contains all the sample data for the course. Inside the ZIP file is a table of contents `00-Contents.txt` that describes all the data files — we'll use a subset of the data files in this unit.

Supplementary reading material is available in the [CoastWatch Utilities User's Guide](../downloads/cwutils_ug_4_0_0.pdf) in the following sections:

  - Section 3.1 - Getting to know CDAT
  - Section 3.2 - Loading data files
  - Section 3.3 - Navigating in CDAT
  - Section 3.4 - Changing data color images
  - Section 3.5 - Displaying coastlines, grids, and more
  - Section 3.10 - Exporting images and data
  - Section 3.11 - User Preferences

If you prefer to learn by watching videos, there is a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_-bsOLKMYJybI8chOl90HWWd_jTsaO3e) for many of the same CDAT features we show, and links to specific videos from the pages in this unit.
